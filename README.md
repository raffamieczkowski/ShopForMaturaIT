3. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server.

## Your Job

Your primary task is to implement the pages outlined above. This repository is pre-configured with starter code using Vite, Vue 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. We expect you to utilize these technologies to complete the assignment. However, you are welcome to incorporate any additional libraries or tools you find suitable.

While there's no strict time limit, we anticipate that you could complete this assignment within 4-8 hours. Completing all items in the **Extras** section is not mandatory, but we encourage you to implement a few of your choice to showcase your skills further.

Regarding the design aspect of the project, we haven't provided any specific design templates. You have the creative freedom to design the website as you see fit. Feel free to sketch your own designs or seek inspiration from online resources such as [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/), [Behance](https://www.behance.net/), [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/), etc. Remember, the primary goal of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to create a functional SPA.

We are looking for:

- Clean, readable code.
- Practical project structure.
- Effective use of Vue 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
